      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-5--june-17-to-june-23&#34;&gt;üìí Week 5 ‚Äî June 17 to June 23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics:&lt;/strong&gt; Exams! Programming, Math Analysis, and Logic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the most intense week so far: three exams ‚Äî one each day. In Programming, we were given a task involving list processing and recursion. I passed with an ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù because I solved it using a loop and added an alternative version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mathematical Logic, truth tables saved the day again ‚Äî we had to prove an implication. I got a bit confused at first but managed to correct it and pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math Analysis was the toughest: problems on finding maximums, minimums, and identifying points of discontinuity. I passed with a ‚Äúgood,‚Äù but it was close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üéâ First exam session is over! Summer lies ahead, but I‚Äôm already making plans to dive deeper into C++ and algorithm studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Week 4</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-4--june-10-to-june-16&#34;&gt;üìï Week 4 ‚Äî June 10 to June 16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics:&lt;/strong&gt; Programming Practice, Proofs in Logic, Intensive Exam Preparation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Programming, we built a calculator using functions and conditionals. Sounds simple, but debugging took a lot of time ‚Äî wrong types, misplaced lines, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Logic, we had our first serious test on transforming logical formulas. I messed up the first part a bit but reviewed my mistakes and passed the retake with an excellent score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Math Analysis, we‚Äôre actively preparing for the final assessment. We revisited all the differentiation rules and worked through combined problems. Studying in mini-groups and explaining to each other really helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚è≥ Realized that consistent effort works better than cramming. Time to rethink my study approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Week 3</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-3--june-3-to-june-9&#34;&gt;üìó Week 3 ‚Äî June 3 to June 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics:&lt;/strong&gt; Derivatives of Composite Functions, Propositional Logic, Loops and Functions in Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Programming, we started writing functions, learning about arguments and return values. I especially enjoyed the assignment where we implemented a recursive factorial function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Logic, we moved on to propositional logic and began simplifying expressions using logical laws. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating how everything can be formalized into basic building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematical Analysis was rewarding ‚Äî we learned how to find derivatives of composite functions using the chain rule. There were a lot of tasks, but things are starting to make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚úÖ Successfully passed the first logic quiz ‚Äî 9/10. The key is not to rush and double-check every step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-2--may-27-to-june-2&#34;&gt;üìò Week 2 ‚Äî May 27 to June 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics:&lt;/strong&gt; Functions and Derivatives, Logical Operations and Truth Tables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued studying derivatives, focusing on differentiation rules and common mistakes. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how much precision of wording matters in mathematical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mathematical Logic, we learned the basic logical connectors: implication, disjunction, and negation. We practiced building truth tables and proving logical equivalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üß† The hardest part was not mixing up ‚Äúif-then‚Äù and ‚Äúonly if.‚Äù Logic really does feel like a programming language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Week 1</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-1--may-20-to-may-26&#34;&gt;üìö Week 1 ‚Äî May 20 to May 26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduction to Programming, Basics of Mathematical Analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week marked the beginning of serious classes. In Programming, we covered the basics of Python syntax ‚Äî variables, conditionals, and loops. In practice, we wrote simple scripts and trained step-by-step code analysis skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mathematical Analysis, we got introduced to limits and the definition of the derivative. It was challenging but fascinating ‚Äî the instructor showed how the theory connects to real-world problems in physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üìå Takeaway: without repetition, nothing sticks. I‚Äôve started taking regular notes and solving extra problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
